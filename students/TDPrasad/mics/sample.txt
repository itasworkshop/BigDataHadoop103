1. What is Default replication factor and how will you change it at file level?
1
Namenode's URI is hdfs://localhost:8020, it’s configured with fs.default.name property that’s specified
in $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/core-site.xml
NOTE: 8020 and 9000 are IPC ports for namenode. The default port for namenode UI is 50070.

2
Namenode will store its image under /home/hadoop/Training/hadoop_work/data/name, it's configured
with dfs.namenode.name.dir property thats specified in $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml

3
Datanode will store data blocks under /home/hadoop/Training/hadoop_work/data/data, it's configured
with dfs.datanode.data.dir property that’s specified in $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml

4
Replication is set to 1, it's configured with dfs.replication property that’s specified in
$HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml


Perform Solution
1. Perform the following steps:
	$ cd $HADOOP_HOME/sbin
	$ ./start-dfs.sh This will start the Namenode, Secondary Namenode all the configured
	Datanodes, which in this case is just one (localhost)
	You can verify with the browser or via command line:
		Open a browser and just navigate to http://localhost:50070, make sure there are no warnings
	under 'Cluster Summary' section and there is 1 live node. We must make sure there are no 'Dead Nodes' 
	
	Secondary Namenode can be confirmed via http://localhost:50090
	Execute on the command line $ hadoop dfsadmin -report, you will get a report about the
	live node 1, dead node 0
2. $ hdfs dfs -mkdir /exercise1
3. Perform the following steps:
a. $ cd /home/cloudera/Data
b. $ hdfs dfs -put  /exercise1/
4. $ hdfs dfs -ls /exercise1/
5. Perform the following steps:
a. $ hdfs dfs -du -h largedeck.txt
	693 M  693 M  largedeck.txt
6. $ hdfs dfs -cat largedeck.txt | head -n 25 largedeck.txt
7. $ hdfs dfs -cp /exercise1/largedeck.txt /exercise1/largedeckcopy.txt
8. $ hdfs dfs -get /exercise1/hamlet.txt hamlet_copy.txt
9. $ hdfs fsck /
10.hdfs dfs -cp largedeck.txt /user/cloudera/new_folder
 $ hdfs dfs -rm new_folder

11. $ hdfs dfs -rm -r 
12. $ hdfs dfs -help
