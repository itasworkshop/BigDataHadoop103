create table cards3(color string,suit string,type string)
clustered by (color) into 2 buckets;

create table cards4(color string,suit string,type string)
clustered by (color) into 2 buckets;

create table cards5(color string,suit string,type string)
clustered by (color) into 2 buckets;

set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;

insert overwrite table cards4 select color,type, count(suit) from cards group by color,type;


insert overwrite table cards5 select color,suit, type from cards;
